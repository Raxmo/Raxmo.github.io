                This is just the landing page for an archive o the ramblings of a mad-man.
                Oh, don't worry, there's hopefully some usefull information found on this site.
                Also, maybe some games or something. Once I actually ake the and what have you that is.
                If you care, there's a little blurb abut me too. If you care, you care. If not, then not.

                I have been making games since about 2007 or so.
                While rather successfull at making games, financial success has still evaded me.
                I have experience in making games in Clickteam Fusion, Unity, Unreal, raw C#, HTML/CSS/JS, and even Unigen.
                Currently, I've decided to step away from using pre-built engines in favor of writing my games from scratch.
                Why? Because I can.
            </p>
            <p>
                All joking aside, I'm going sans-engine mainly to learn more about how games really work, as well as learn new skills in programming.
                I've learned quite a lot about engine architecture and also general software engineering.
                One of my favorite fields I've taken up has been graphics programming.
                Do I think I can write a better engine than Epic Games? No. Not even close.
                But can I write one that fits my project more precisely?
                Absolutely. And it's more fun for me.
